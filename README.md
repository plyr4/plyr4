### welcome

![total visitors to my stuff](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=${your.username}.${your.repo.id})

a little about me: my name is Dave, I'm a programmer, engineer, and aspiring game designer. I'm also a big fan of role playing games and enjoy cooking soups in my free time. ðŸ¥£

some GitHub projects I've worked on:

### Vela

I've done a lot of work on Target Co's official pipeline automation framework, [Vela](https://github.com/go-vela).
Most of my contributions go towards building and improving the [user interface](https://github.com/go-vela/ui), written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

I also enjoy working with [Go](https://go.dev/), lately contributing mostly to the Vela [server](https://github.com/go-vela/server/graphs/contributors) and the [worker](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/graphs/contributors).

### Skelly

[Skelly](https://github.com/plyr4/skelly) is a simple Slack chatbot that is designed to respond to user typing events. It is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and utilizes the slack-go library for most of the Slack integrations. It also supports [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a backend for storing data.
