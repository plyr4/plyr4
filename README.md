### welcome

My name is Dave. I'm a programmer, engineer, and aspiring game designer. I studied computer science at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) in Ann Arbor and I'm currently working as a senior software engineer at [Target Co.](https://corporate.target.com/careers), primarily designing and maintaining corporate CICD systems like [Vela](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/), [Drone](https://www.drone.io/enterprise/opensource/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). I also have fun creating chat-ops solutions like [Slack](https://api.slack.com/) bots. Lately I've been into [Go](https://go.dev/), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/).

I'm also a big fan of role playing games and I enjoy making soups in my free time. ü•£‚öîÔ∏è

Lately I've been interested in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [3D shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader) rendering and [Unity](https://unity.com/).

Here are some GitHub projects I've worked on, feel free to check them out!
### Vela

I've done a lot of work on Target Co's official pipeline automation framework, [Vela](https://github.com/go-vela).
Most of my contributions go towards building and improving the [user interface](https://github.com/go-vela/ui), written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

I also enjoy working with [Go](https://go.dev/), lately contributing mostly to the Vela [server](https://github.com/go-vela/server/graphs/contributors) and the [worker](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/graphs/contributors).  

### Skelly
[Skelly](https://github.com/plyr4/skelly) is a simple Slack chatbot that is designed to respond to user typing events. It is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and utilizes the slack-go library for most of the Slack integrations. It also supports [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a backend for storing data.
