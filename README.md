### welcome

![total visitors to my stuff](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=${your.username}.${your.repo.id})

A little about me: my name is Dave, I'm a programmer, engineer, and aspiring game designer. I studied computer science at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) in Ann Arbor and I'm currently working as a senior software engineer at [Target Co.](https://corporate.target.com/careers), primarily designing and maintaining corporate CICD systems like [Vela](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/), [Drone](https://www.drone.io/enterprise/opensource/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/).

I'm also a big fan of role playing games and I enjoy making soups in my free time. ü•£‚öîÔ∏è

Lately I've been interested in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [D3](https://d3js.org/) rendering and [Unity](https://unity.com/).

Here are some GitHub projects I've worked on, feel free to check them out!

### Vela

<br/>

I've done a lot of work on Target Co's official pipeline automation framework, [Vela](https://github.com/go-vela).
Most of my contributions go towards building and improving the [user interface](https://github.com/go-vela/ui), written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

I also enjoy working with [Go](https://go.dev/), lately contributing mostly to the Vela [server](https://github.com/go-vela/server/graphs/contributors) and the [worker](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/graphs/contributors).

### Skelly


[Skelly](https://github.com/plyr4/skelly) is a simple Slack chatbot that is designed to respond to user typing events. It is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and utilizes the slack-go library for most of the Slack integrations. It also supports [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a backend for storing data.
